# Phase 1: Database Schema Implementation

This folder contains all the SQL scripts needed to implement the database schema for the sound presets system.

## 🎯 What Phase 1 Accomplishes

✅ **Database Tables**: Creates `sounds`, `sound_presets`, and `preset_sounds` tables  
✅ **Storage Bucket**: Sets up `user-sounds` bucket for file uploads  
✅ **Row Level Security**: Implements proper user isolation policies  
✅ **Performance**: Adds indexes for efficient queries  
✅ **Data Integrity**: Sets up foreign keys, constraints, and triggers

## 🚀 Quick Implementation

### Option 1: Run the Complete Script (Recommended)

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**

   - Go to your Supabase project
   - Navigate to **SQL Editor**

2. **Run the Main Script**

   ```sql
   -- Copy and paste the entire content of sound_presets_schema.sql
   -- Click "Run" to execute
   ```

3. **Verify Success**
   ```sql
   -- Copy and paste the content of test_schema.sql
   -- Click "Run" to verify everything was created correctly
   ```

### Option 2: Step-by-Step (If Option 1 Fails)

If you encounter any errors with the main script:

1. **Follow the Step Guide**

   - Open `sound_presets_setup_steps.md`
   - Follow each step individually
   - Run each SQL block separately in the SQL Editor

2. **Troubleshoot Issues**
   - The step guide includes common error solutions
   - Each step can be run independently

## 🔍 Verification

After running the scripts, you should see:

### ✅ Expected Results

**Tables Created:**

```
✅ public.sounds (user uploaded sound metadata)
✅ public.sound_presets (saved preset combinations)
✅ public.preset_sounds (join table with volume levels)
```

**Storage Setup:**

```
✅ user-sounds bucket created
✅ 50MB file size limit
✅ Audio file types allowed
```

**Security Configured:**

```
✅ Row Level Security enabled
✅ User isolation policies active
✅ Storage access policies set
```

**Performance Optimized:**

```
✅ Database indexes created
✅ Foreign key constraints set
✅ Automatic timestamp updates
```

### 🧪 Test the Setup

Run the verification script to confirm everything works:

```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor, paste and run test_schema.sql
-- Look for ✅ success indicators in the results
```

Expected verification results:

- **3 tables** created
- **9+ indexes** created
- **1 storage bucket** created
- **12+ RLS policies** created
- **2 triggers** created

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "relation auth.users does not exist"

**Solution**: Your user authentication tables aren't set up yet.

```sql
-- First run your existing user setup script
-- Then retry the sound presets schema
```

### Issue: Storage bucket creation fails

**Solution**: Create the bucket manually in the Supabase Dashboard:

1. Go to **Storage** → **Create bucket**
2. **Name**: `user-sounds`
3. **Public**: ❌ (private)
4. **File size limit**: `50MB`
5. **MIME types**: `audio/mpeg, audio/wav, audio/ogg, audio/mp4, audio/x-m4a`

### Issue: Permission denied errors

**Solution**: Make sure you're using an admin account in Supabase.

### Issue: RLS policies not working

**Solution**: Run the verification script to check policy creation:

```sql
-- From test_schema.sql, run the RLS verification section
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'public';
```

## 🎉 Success Confirmation

When Phase 1 is complete, you should be able to:

1. **See new tables** in your Supabase Table Editor
2. **View the storage bucket** in your Storage section
3. **Run test queries** without permission errors
4. **See all ✅ indicators** in the verification script

## ➡️ Next Steps

Once Phase 1 is successfully implemented:

1. **✅ Phase 1 Complete** - Database schema ready
2. **🔄 Ready for Phase 2** - Built-in sounds setup
3. **📁 Next**: Organize built-in sound files in `public/presets/`
4. **⚡ After**: Create sound management services

## 📞 Need Help?

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check the step-by-step guide** in `sound_presets_setup_steps.md`
2. **Run the verification script** in `test_schema.sql`
3. **Look for error messages** in the Supabase SQL Editor
4. **Check existing tables** - make sure `public.users` exists first

---

**🎯 Goal**: By the end of Phase 1, you'll have a robust database foundation that can handle both custom user uploads and built-in sound presets with proper security and performance.
